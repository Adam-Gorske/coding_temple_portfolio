<div class="mainbody">
<p><b>Adam Roy Gorske</b> (born February 4, 1990) is a human being. There is nothing too extraorinary about him, but he has been known to be easily amused. He doesn't need to go to a park of amusement, but he does enjoy a good park. Not the place where a car goes, but where there are trees and grass, and people frolicking about. On occasion he enjoys a good picnic, or at least the idea of one. The last picnic he was spotted at was in 2018. He has been to many parks, including National ones since then, but there haven't been any picnics.</p>
<p>He thinks his local library has cut a deal with him for not charging late fees. Little does he know it's a county wide initiative to not punish those without the means to pay them. It's a pretty sweet library system that lets him enjoy all the digital editions of comics he can download over his very slow internet. While he does prefer a good paper version of anything, you can't beat the convenience of having them all at your fingertips when you want them.</p>

<h3>Cat</h3>
<img src="images/cat.jpg" width="240" class="bodyimage">
<p>What is a person called when they own the business next to yours? Is it still just a neighbor? For the sake of this story, we'll call them a neighbor. Adam's neighbor was doing animal spirit card readings one day, and his came back as a cat. He thought it was fitting, so he didn't ask for another one.</p>
<h3>Trashy Family</h3>
<img src="images/soda_pressing.jpg" width="240" class="bodyimage">
<p>Adam grew up in the waste industry. He was participating in parades and riding in garbage trucks before he could properly speak. He's not that old, but safety was different back then.</p>
<p>From 2012 - 2017 Adam thought he was helping save the world. He did waste reduction education, which is a more marketable way of saying, he taught people about recycling. He helped schools (he even had a robot he got to play with for assemblies), businesses, apartments, and cities with their waste reduction and recycling efforts. "Know before you throw!" is what he would say before strolling off to another appointment. </p>
<h3>DIY BAR</h3>
<p>In 2015 Adam co-founded a business with his brother, DIY BAR. His brother's name isn't DIY BAR. His brother's name is Jason, and the bar's name is DIY BAR. It's easily confused if taken out of context.
</p>
<p>DIY BAR is a place for crafty and not so crafty people. They provide all of the tools, materials, instructions, and liquid encouragment for folks to get crafty.
</p>
<p>In the summer of 2022, Adam took a step out of DIY BAR. He walked out of the physical business, but he is also no longer a part of the business.

<h3>Portland and Pizza</h3>

<p>Adam currently resides in the woods of Portland, OR with his girlfriend, 2 dogs, 4 chickens, and 1000's of bees. His current diet consists mostly of pizza and chocolate.</p>

<h3>The Garden Will be Weedy, But His Mind Will be Full</h3>
<p>While he has never done crystal meth (he can barely handle weed), he wanted to show he knew how to use a strikethrough. Since turning this in he may have forgotten because there's been so much learning over the past few weeks, and he has one more full day before the bootcamp actually starts. It's okay though because he's taken pretty good notes.</p>
<p>Adam expects his garden to become mostly weeds this summer, but he's okay with it because he will be feeding his mind plenty of new information.</p>
<p>Learning to program has been on the back burner for the past 2 years.
            <p>He knows what he likes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working collaboratively</li>
                    <li>Problem solving (and eventually seeing results)</li>
                    <li>Learning new things</li>
                    <li>Being able to work remotely</li>
                    <li>Having a work / life balance</li>
                    <li>Being compensated nicely for the work I'm doing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Programming seemed to check all of these boxes, and then some. He started with free online resources, then moved to some courses through Udemy to get a taste of what programming might be like. He would spend a few hours every morning going over a course to make sure he was enjoying what he was doing. After a month or so of doing this, he decided he would benefit from going all in on a coding bootcamp.</p>
                <p>Another month or so of researching bootcamps lead him to Coding Temple.</p>
                <p>He's excited to dive deeper into the program, be challenged daily, and see where his path goes. At this point he doesn't have an end destination, but he's looking to enjoy the ride.</p>
